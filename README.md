In your terminal, you need to "go to" the folder where you downloaded the project.

#### If you put it on your Desktop:

**Windows:**
```
cd Desktop
cd "cu-boulder-aed-inventory-system"
```

**Mac:**
```
cd Desktop
cd "cu-boulder-aed-inventory-system"
```

**Tip**: If the folder has a different name, replace "cu-boulder-aed-inventory-system" with whatever your folder is actually called.

### Step 5: Start the Web Server

Copy and paste this command into your terminal and press Enter:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

**If that doesn't work, try:**

2. In the address bar, type exactly: `http://localhost:8000/main.html`
3. Press Enter

**üéâ The app should now load!** You'll see a map of CU Boulder with building markers.

## üéÆ How to Use the App

### Basic Workflow:
1. **First time setup**: Click "Improve Building Locations" to get better GPS coordinates
2. **Create work blocks**: Click "Recalculate Clusters" to automatically group buildings
3. **Customize routes**: Drag buildings between groups or reorder them
4. **Generate reports**: Click "Generate PDF Report" to create printable work plans

### Key Features:
- **Drag the map pins**: Click and hold to move building locations
- **Drag buildings in lists**: Use the ‚ãÆ‚ãÆ handle to reorder buildings
- **Edit building details**: Click "Edit" next to any building
- **Save your work**: Click "Save State to CSV" to backup your configuration

---

## üìÑ Generating Work Reports

1. Make sure you have work blocks created (see "Recalculate Clusters")
2. Click "Generate PDF Report"
3. Wait a few moments for the PDF to generate
4. The report will automatically download to your computer
5. Print or share the PDF with your team!

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Command not found" error:
- **Windows**: Make sure you checked "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- **Mac/Linux**: Try using `python3` instead of `python`

### App won't load in browser:
- Make sure the terminal is still running (you should see the "Serving HTTP" message)
- Check that you typed the address correctly: `http://localhost:8000/main.html`
- Try refreshing the page

### Maps not showing:
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Some firewalls block map tiles - try from a different network

### PDF generation not working:
- Make sure you clicked "Recalculate Clusters" first
- Wait for all maps to fully load before generating PDF
- Try refreshing the page and trying again

### Still having problems?
- Close the terminal window
- Start over from Step 4
- Make sure you're in the right folder
